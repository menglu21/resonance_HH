## 2024-06-27 - lxplus7 CC7 termination https://cern.ch/otg0147045, since we need CMSSW_10_6_X for the Run2 analysis, we need to use singularity to use the CMSSW_10_6_X

0. login to lxplus8 or lxplus9, execute "cmssw-el7" to launch the singularity. **This must be done before set up the CMSSW**, otherwise there will be imcompatibility between arch and cmssw
1. cmsrel CMSSW_10_6_30
2. Set up NanoAOD tools
   ```bash
   cd CMSSW_10_6_30/src

   git clone https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/nanoAOD-tools.git PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools

   cd PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools

   cmsenv

   scram b
   ```

3. Set up codes
   ```bash
   cd python/postprocessing

   ##clone this repository

   git clone https://github.com/menglu21/resonance_HH.git analysis

   cd $CMSSW_BASE/src

   scram b
   ```
    Noticed that the `crab_help.py` is written in python3, hence the `scram b` in CMSSW would leave some error message. Since this crab helper normally would not be included by other codes, you can ignore these errors.

4. Substitute some outdated files with `init.sh`
   ```bash
   cd $CMSSW_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/python/postprocessing/analysis

   source init.sh 2017
   ```

## submit jobs

cd analysis/crab

using the configure files under 'configs', namely,

crab submit -c configs/DoubleEGB_cfg.py

rm crab_DoubleEG_B/inputs/*.tgz 

You can also check `crab/auto_crab_example` to run crab jobs batchly and automatically.

## corrections

the modules (most of them are corrections) used can be seen from analysis/crab/crab_script.py,

N.B. the egamma correction is already applied default in NanoAOD

#### for MC:

countHistogramsModule(): store the opsitive and negative events number for weight apply

puWeight_2017(): pileup reweight

PrefCorr(): L1-prefiring correction

muonIDISOSF2017(): muon ID/ISO SF

muonScaleRes2017(): muon momentum correction, i.e., the Rochester correction

eleRECOSF2017(): electron RECO SF

eleIDSF2017(): electron IS SF

jmeCorrections_UL2017MC(): JetMET correction

btagSF2017UL(): b tag SF

#### for Data:

muonScaleRes2017(): muon momentum correction, i.e., the Rochester correction

jmeCorrections_UL2017*(): JetMET correction

### 1. pileup reweight 
(this correction is applied using the official module, so we need to update the rootfiles for pileup and do some modification on the official module. The files under others/for_pileup/ can be used directly)

#### data

according to https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PileupJSONFileforData#Centrally_produced_ROOT_histogra, use histograms under /afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSCOMM/COMM_DQM/certification/Collisions17/13TeV/PileUp/UltraLegacy/, combine three histograms to a single one with name “pileup, pileup_plus, pileup_minus”

#### MC

https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PileupScenariosRun2

move "mcPileupUL2017.root" and "PileupHistogram-goldenJSON-13tev-UL2017-99bins_withVar.root" to python/postprocessing/data/pileup/, and move "puWeightProducer.py" to python/postprocessing/modules/common/

### 2. prefiring correction 
(needed files are in others/for_prefiring, can be used directly)

details are here: Pre-firing: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/L1ECALPrefiringWeightRecipe#Accessing_the_UL2017_maps, in order to use the current NanoAOD module, extract separate rootfiles from https://github.com/cms-data/PhysicsTools-PatUtils/raw/master/L1PrefiringMaps.root

#### data & MC

move "others/for_prefiring/*.root" to NanoAODTools/data/prefire_maps/, and move "others/for_prefiring/PrefireCorr.py" to postprocessing/modules/common/

### 3. JME correction
(needed files are in others/for_jme, can be used directly)
move the *.tgz to PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/data/jme, and move "jetmetHelperRun2.py" to PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/python/postprocessing/modules/jme

### 4. Bjet related
(needed files are in others/for_btv, can be used directly)
move "btagSFProducer.py" to src/PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/python/postprocessing/modules/btv, move the *.csv to PhysicsTools/NanoAODTools/data/btagSF

## After finisihing all the file moving, please remember delete the "others" directory, as the crab submission have size limit.
